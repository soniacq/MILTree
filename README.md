# Multi-Instance Learning Tree (MILTree) visualization

Multiple-instance learning (MIL) is a paradigm of machine learning that aims to classify a set (bag) of objects (instances), assigning labels only to the bags. MILTree is a multiscale tree-based visualization to support MIL. The first level of the tree represents the bags, and the second level represents the instances belonging to each bag, allowing the user to understand the data in an intuitive way. MILTree is available through the Visual Classification system. 

## Demo
